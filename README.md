This script is an extended functionality version of the standard 3ds Max batch render dialog.

It adds:
- Multi-row editing such as renaming and deleting
- The ability to move rows up/down (render order)
- V-Ray layer presets to be applied before rendering
- Better output path control (base output path + row name + frame #)
- Override toggles for each frame range, resolution, pixel aspect, output path
